"select_one yes_no","consent_remote","4. Hello, my name is ___ and I work for REACH Initiative. Since 2012, my organization has been conducting interviews with people across Iraq to inform the humanitarian response in Iraq. We ask households about their living conditions and challenges, in order to get a better understanding of how aid organizations can support the people of Iraq. Usually we do this face to face, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is better to call people instead. This interview will take around 40 minutes, whatever you say is treated with strict confidentiality and your answers remain anonymous at all time (no personal information will be shared with anyone, not even whether you participated in this interview or not). You are free to stop the interview at any time, or decline to answer certain questions. The information you provide us will be used in reports and shared with humanitarian decision-makers in Iraq. Do you agree to participate? ","مرحبًا ، اسمي ___ وأعمل في مبادرة REACH. منذ عام 2012 ، تجري منظمتي مقابلات مع أشخاص في جميع أنحاء العراق لإبلاغ الاستجابة الإنسانية في العراق. نسأل الأسر عن ظروف معيشتهم وتحدياتهم ، من أجل الحصول على فهم أفضل لكيفية مساعدة منظمات المساعدة لشعب العراق. عادة نقوم بذلك وجهاً لوجه ، ولكن بسبب جائحة COVID-19 ، من الأفضل الاتصال بالأشخاص بدلاً من ذلك. ستستغرق هذه المقابلة حوالي 40 دقيقة ، أيًا كان ما تقوله يتم التعامل معه بسرية تامة وستظل إجاباتك مجهولة في جميع الأوقات (لن تتم مشاركة أي معلومات شخصية مع أي شخص ، حتى إذا كنت قد شاركت في هذه المقابلة أم لا). لك مطلق الحرية في إيقاف المقابلة في أي وقت ، أو رفض الإجابة على أسئلة معينة. سيتم استخدام المعلومات التي تقدمها لنا في التقارير ومشاركتها مع صناع القرار الإنساني في العراق. هل توافق على المشاركة؟","","","true","","",".='yes'","End survey if the person is not willing to participate","الرجاء انهاء الاستبيان اذا كان المجيب لا يريد التكلم","","",""
